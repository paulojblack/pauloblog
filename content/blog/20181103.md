While toying around with setting up [docker-airflow](https://github.com/puckel/docker-airflow) I finally got fed up enough with the hassle of typing `alias ll='lha'` *every single time* I logged into a new server that I got around to ticking off one of the items in my [Things I Want to Do]({{< ref "/code" >}}) list and installed [sshrc](https://github.com/Russell91/sshrc/blob/master/sshrc)!

I waited wait to long to do that. Immediately works out of the box with `brew install sshrc` then filling in whatever you want executed upon login in a `~/.sshrc` file. For now I just included my two must haves: `alias ll=ls -lha` and `alias sourcebash='source ~/.bash_profile`.
