Simple little change today, deployed [a new theme](https://github.com/EmielH/tale-hugo) that looks way better but I had to fork and add some html to accommodate  the page structure I wanted. It's responsive at least, which I suppose I was overly optimistic in expecting any cms tool to be in 2018.

Been pretty hard to stick to one post a day, I chose a bad time to start doing this considering the most senior member of our team is leaving, making me the new "go to" guy. Oh well, better late than never
