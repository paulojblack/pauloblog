## I assign you to spread your chunked curry
Probably didn't think this one all the way through today, but I found a bug in an API I'm building that resulted from a third party's documentation on an endpoint I use being uncharacteristically absent. Although I think it's fun to write very functional and concise code, I usually stay away from it because it tends to be a giant pain in the ass to maintain for any other programmer, or me if more than 2 weeks have passed since I wrote it. Today I wasn't able to avoid it however, due to time constraints and kinda wanting to write anything other than super simple declarative code.

I essentially had to [chunk](https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.11#chunk) an array of ids, then call an endpoint with each chunk until I had iterated through the entire original array. So instead of  
```
const myIds = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
const result = callEndpoint(myIds)
```

I had something like
```
const myIdChunks = _.chunk([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 2)

const result = myIdChunks.map(await callEndpoint)
```
Now you may already see the funkiness here.
