# Things I Want to Look at
https://atom.io/packages/remote-sync

# Things I want to do
- Build a `systips` tool in Go in the vein of `fortune` to log out useful miscellaneous system related tips upon shell open/profile refresh
- Finally put my working machine dotfiles and setup scripts in working order
- Not abandon this blog


# Things I wanted to do and ended up doing
- Setup bashrc/bash_profile sync when I login to remote boxes  
That was easy... shoulda done that forever ago [sshrc](https://github.com/Russell91/sshrc/blob/master/sshrc)
